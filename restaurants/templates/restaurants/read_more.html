                <p><strong>BUZTABLE</strong> is designed to bridge the gap between restaurant reservations and online food ordering. This chapter introduces the project, outlines the problem statement, and sets the stage for the detailed discussion that follows.</p>
                
                <h3>1.1 Background</h3>
                <p>The restaurant industry has seen a significant transformation with the advent of technology. Traditional methods of reserving (1) tables and ordering food have given way to online platforms that offer convenience and efficiency. BUZTABLE aims to integrate these functionalities into a single platform, providing a seamless experience for both diners and restaurant owners.</p>
                
                <h3>1.2 Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Current restaurant reservation systems and food delivery (2) platforms operate independently, leading to inefficiencies and inconvenience for users who need to switch between multiple apps. There is a need for a unified platform that combines these services.</p>
                
                <h3>1.3 Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop a comprehensive platform for restaurant reservations and food ordering.</li>
                    <li>Ensure a user-friendly interface for both customers and restaurant staff.</li>
                    <li>Implement robust security measures to protect user data.</li>
                    <li>Provide a scalable solution that can handle high traffic.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>1.4 Scope</h3>
                <p>BUZTable is a web-based platform that merges the functionalities of restaurant reservations and online food ordering. It will enable diners to make reservations, browse restaurant menus, order food for takeaway or delivery, and review their dining experiences. Restaurant owners will have the ability to manage reservations, orders, menu items, tables, and promotions. The system will integrate with payment gateways for processing transactions and with third-party delivery partners for efficient delivery operations.</p>
                <p>The platform is expected to serve multiple geographical regions and will support multiple languages and currencies to cater to an international audience. This document covers all the features required for the platform, including user registration, restaurant management, reservation systems, payment integration, reviews, and order management.</p>
                
                <h3>1.5 Structure of the Thesis</h3>
                <p>The thesis is structured as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chapter 2 reviews the existing literature on restaurant reservation systems and food delivery platforms.</li>
                    <li>Chapter 3 discusses the system design and architecture of BUZTABLE.</li>
                    <li>Chapter 4 covers the implementation details, including the technology stack and development process.</li>
                    <li>Chapter 5 presents the results and discusses the performance of the system.</li>
                    <li>Finally, Chapter 6 concludes the thesis and suggests future enhancements.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>1.6 Overview</h3>
                <p>This document is structured to provide an in-depth description of the BUZTable platform, its features, architecture, and other technical aspects. It will cover functional requirements, non-functional requirements, system features, database design, security protocols, and performance criteria, providing a clear understanding of the project and its objectives. The document will also serve as a guide for future maintenance and scalability of the system.</p>

                <h1>Literature Review</h1>
                <h3>3.1 Online Reservation Systems</h3>
                <p>Online reservation systems have revolutionized the way diners book tables at restaurants. Several platforms, such as OpenTable and Resy, have simplified the reservation process by allowing users to book tables from their devices. These systems offer features like real-time availability, instant confirmation, and reminders, which enhance user convenience and restaurant efficiency. However, these systems often lack integration with food ordering services, leading to a fragmented user experience.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Food Delivery Platforms</h3>
                <p>Food delivery platforms like Foodpanda, Uber Eats, and DoorDash have significantly impacted the food service industry by providing users with the convenience of ordering food from their favorite restaurants and having it delivered to their doorstep. These platforms offer extensive menus, user reviews, and various payment options. However, they operate separately from reservation systems, creating a need for a unified solution that combines both functionalities.</p>

                <h3>3.3 User Experience in Dining Applications</h3>
                <p>User experience (UX) is a critical factor in the success of dining applications. An intuitive interface, seamless navigation, and personalized recommendations enhance user satisfaction. Studies have shown that applications that prioritize UX see higher engagement and retention rates. Key elements of a good UX in dining applications include easy menu browsing, simple reservation and ordering processes, and quick access to customer support.</p>

                <h3>3.4 Comparative Analysis</h3>
                <p>A comparative analysis of existing reservation and food delivery platforms reveals a gap in the market for an integrated solution. While platforms like OpenTable excel in table reservations and Foodpanda in food delivery, there is no single platform that offers both services efficiently. BUZTABLE aims to fill this gap by combining the best features of both types of platforms into a comprehensive solution.</p>

                <h1>System Design and Architecture</h1>

        <h3>5.1 Overview</h3>
        <p>The BUZTABLE system is designed to provide a seamless experience for users looking to reserve tables and order food from restaurants. The architecture is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and scalability.</p>

        <h3>5.2 System Components</h3>
        <p>The BUZTABLE system consists of the following key modules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Module:</strong> Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.</li>
            <li><strong>Restaurant Module:</strong> Manages restaurant profiles, menus, and table availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Reservation Module:</strong> Facilitates table reservations, cancellations, and modifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Order Module:</strong> Manages food orders, payments, and delivery tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Admin Module:</strong> Provides administrative functions for managing users, restaurants, and system settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Database Design</h3>
        <p>The database design is a crucial aspect of BUZTABLE, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval. The schema includes tables for users, restaurants, menus, reservations, orders, and more. ([6] Kim, 2021)</p>
